# Databases with AI Capabilities

Databases with AI capabilities combine traditional storage and querying functions with integrated machine learning, artificial intelligence algorithms, or smart analytics. Below are some types of databases and platforms with AI functionalities:

## 1. AI-Native Databases
These databases are specifically designed for AI and machine learning workloads, often featuring built-in deep learning and neural network support.

- **[SingularityDB](https://github.com/singularitydb/singularitydb)**: Designed for complex data analysis tasks, integrating an AI engine to optimize queries, automate data management, and provide intelligent insights.
- **[NeuDB](https://github.com/neuDB/neuDB)**: AI-driven database leveraging neural networks to optimize query processing and predict data access patterns.

## 2. AI-Enhanced Traditional Databases
These databases enhance their traditional relational or NoSQL capabilities by integrating AI and machine learning functionalities.

- **[Oracle Autonomous Database](https://github.com/oracle/oracle-db)**: Features built-in AI for automatic tuning, repairing, and optimizing the database, integrated with Oracle Machine Learning.
- **[IBM Db2 AI for z/OS](https://github.com/IBM/db2-ai-zos)**: Uses AI tools for performance tuning, optimization, and data analysis, automating database management and decision-making.
- **[Microsoft SQL Server](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server)**: Integrates machine learning services, allowing users to train, test, and deploy AI models directly within the database.

## 3. AI-Driven Data Warehouses
These data warehouses combine AI and machine learning capabilities, supporting large-scale data analysis and modeling.
