The claim-check pattern is used to reduce the cost and size of large messages by first storing the data in an external storage location and then sending a reference to the data/event to the consumer.

A[[Message with data]]-->|1.| B((Producer))
B -->|2. Store data, save key| C[(Storage)]
D[[Smaller message with key only]]
B -->|3.| D -->|4.| E((Consumer))
C -->|5. Get data with key| E -->|6.| F[[Message with data]]
```

1. Send message
2. Store message in data store
3. Enqueue the message's reference (i.e. key)
4. Read the message's reference
5. Retrieve the message
6. Process the message

## Claim Check Pattern Advantages

- Reduces cost of data transfer via messaging/streams. This is because storage is usually cheaper than messaging/streaming resources (memory).
- Helps protect the message bus and client from being overwhelmed or slowed down by large messages.
- Allows you to asynchronously process data which can help with scalability/performance.

## Claim Check Pattern Disadvantages

- If the external service used to store the payload fails, then the message will not be delivered.
- Requires additional storage space and adds additional time to store/retrieve data.

## Claim Check Pattern Examples

- Kafka client writes payload to S3/Azure Blob Storage/GCS. Then it sends a notification message. The consumer receives the message and accesses the payload from S3/Azure Blob Storage/GCS.
- In Airflow, you sometimes need to pass data between tasks. You can do this using [XComs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/xcoms.html) but there is a limit to the size of the message you can send. For passing large messages via XComs you can use the claim check pattern.
