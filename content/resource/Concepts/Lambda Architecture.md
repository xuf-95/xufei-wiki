Lambda architecture is a data processing pattern designed to strike a balance between low latency, high throughput, and fault tolerance. This architecture type uses a combination of batch processing to create accurate views of large data sets and real-time stream processing to provide views of live data. The results from both sets can then be merged and presented together.

```mermaid
%%{init: { "flowchart": { "useMaxWidth": true } } }%%
graph LR

A((Data Source))

subgraph Batch Layer
B("Batch view(s)")
end
subgraph Speed Layer
C("Real-time view(s)")
end

A --> B
A --> C

subgraph Serving Layer
D("Combined view(s)")
end

B --> D
C --> D

```

## Lambda Architecture Advantages

- Efficiently serves batch and real-time workloads

## Lambda Architecture Disadvantages

- Duplicated code/logic for both batch and real-time views
